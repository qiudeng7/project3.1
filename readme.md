# project3

- douyin crawler learning project
- still under active development.
- I'm a beginner in English and I'm working on becoming more comfortable with it.
- docker/dockercompose/devcontainer for deployment
- DrissionPage for crawling

thanks for [MediaCrawler](https://github.com/NanmiCoder/MediaCrawler), I've learned a lot from it.

## commit convention
I learned some commit conventions and decided to customize a simplify version to follow.

A prefix with concise description string is enough. Long description will make the commit too complex and not friendly for a English begainner as me.

Here is available prefixes (maybe it will be updated later):

```text
feat: add new feature
fix: fix bug
docs: edit markdown
reading: make some adjustments to improve readability, like comments or code format.
refactor: some changes that will affect the scope of at least a folder.
chore: update dependency
```
